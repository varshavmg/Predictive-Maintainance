Predictive Maintenance 

This Predictive Maintenance mini project uses machine learning to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules based on historical data. Built with Python and libraries like Scikit-learn and Matplotlib, it employs models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest for accurate predictions. To use, clone the repository, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, and run the script using python main.py. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and contributions are welcome
